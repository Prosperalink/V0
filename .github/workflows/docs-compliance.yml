              The documentation organization rule check failed. Please ensure all documentation is properly organized in the \`docs/\` folder.

              ### Required Structure:
              - \`docs/technical/\` - Development guidelines, technical specifications
              - \`docs/project/\` - Project plans, roadmaps, summaries
              - \`docs/ux-ui/\` - Design guidelines, UI/UX specifications
              - \`docs/copywriting/\` - Content guidelines, brand voice
              - \`docs/brand/\` - Brand identity, visual guidelines
              - \`docs/assets/\` - Asset management, media guidelines

              ### To fix:
              1. Run \`npm run check-docs\` locally to see violations
              2. Move documentation files to appropriate \`docs/\` subfolder
              3. Update any references to moved files
              4. Commit the changes

              For more information, see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)`
